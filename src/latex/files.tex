Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine__main_8py}{state\+\_\+machine\+\_\+main.\+py}} \\*The node state\+\_\+machine deals with the building of the state machine\textquotesingle{}s structure. ~\newline
 The architecture of the state machine corresponds to the uml shown in docs/\+State\+Machine.\+jpg file }{\pageref{state__machine__main_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{parser/\mbox{\hyperlink{parser_8py}{parser.\+py}} \\*The functions inside \mbox{\hyperlink{parser_8py}{parser.\+py}} are usefull in order to extract information and keywords from the string published in the topic \textquotesingle{}/speech to text\textquotesingle{}. It\textquotesingle{}s return depends on various factor and can eather be a triple, a single word, or a None object. ~\newline
 The string gets changed in lower case than transformed in a list of single word. ~\newline
 If the calling state is A\+C\+T\+I\+VE each element of the firts list are compared with each element of standard allowed keyword for each of three category. If a keyword for each category is found in the list a triplet is made with the result and is returned. ~\newline
 If the calling state is I\+D\+LE the element in the list are compared to a \textquotesingle{}wakeup word\textquotesingle{} and if that is present its returned. ~\newline
 The standard return for this funcion is a None object that signifies that an error occurred and not enough information has been extracted from the speech to text string }{\pageref{parser_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{states/\mbox{\hyperlink{active_8py}{active.\+py}} \\*The class Active handles the active state. ~\newline
 A\+C\+T\+I\+VE has\+: ~\newline
 -\/ output (active\+\_\+out)\+: a list containing an action, a color and a target given by the parser and not empty. It\textquotesingle{}s the output for the successful outcome. ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (successful)\+: miro menaged to understand a command given by the user and get ready to execute it. ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (time\+\_\+failure)\+: miro didnt menaged to understand a command in the time window given, and moves to failure state }{\pageref{active_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{states/\mbox{\hyperlink{dummy__lfo_8py}{dummy\+\_\+lfo.\+py}} \\*Class Dummy\+L\+FO handles the look for object state. ~\newline
 L\+O\+OK F\+OR O\+B\+J\+E\+CT has\+: ~\newline
 -\/ input (dummy\+\_\+lfo\+\_\+in)\+: a vocal command by an user ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (found)\+: the object has been correctly found ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (recognizing\+\_\+failure)\+: the object has N\+OT been correctly found }{\pageref{dummy__lfo_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{states/\mbox{\hyperlink{dummy__mto_8py}{dummy\+\_\+mto.\+py}} \\*Class Dummy\+M\+TO handles the move towards object state. ~\newline
 M\+O\+VE T\+O\+W\+A\+R\+DS O\+B\+J\+E\+CT has\+: ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (arrived)\+: Mi\+Ro has arrived to the goal object }{\pageref{dummy__mto_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{states/\mbox{\hyperlink{failure_8py}{failure.\+py}} \\*The class Failure handles the failure state. ~\newline
 F\+A\+I\+L\+U\+RE has\+: ~\newline
 -\/ output (reset)\+: miro has expressed a sad behavior after a failure and gets back to idle state }{\pageref{failure_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{states/\mbox{\hyperlink{happy_8py}{happy.\+py}} \\*Class Happy handles the happy state. ~\newline
 H\+A\+P\+PY has\+: ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (ok)\+: Mi\+Ro signals that the goal has been reached }{\pageref{happy_8py}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{states/\mbox{\hyperlink{idle_8py}{idle.\+py}} \\*The class Idle handles the idle state. ~\newline
 I\+D\+LE has\+: ~\newline
 -\/ outcome (miro)\+: miro has heard its wake up word and gets to Active state }{\pageref{idle_8py}}{}
