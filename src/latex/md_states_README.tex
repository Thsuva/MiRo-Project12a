\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{idle_8py}{src/states/idle.\+py}}}}\+: the first state of the state machine waits for the \char`\"{}wake up word\char`\"{} and goes to active state when hears it.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{active_8py}{src/states/active.\+py}}}}\+: this state listens from the {\ttfamily /speech\+\_\+to\+\_\+text} topic and tries to get enough information to start the \char`\"{}look for object\char`\"{} routine.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{dummy__lfo_8py}{src/states/dummy\+\_\+lfo.\+py}}}}\+: dummy state which will contain functions to move the robot and locate the desired object.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{dummy__mto_8py}{src/states/dummy\+\_\+mto.\+py}}}}\+: dummy state which will move the robot toward his destination.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{failure_8py}{src/states/failure.\+py}}}}\+: state of passage where Mi\+Ro signals the failure of one of his actions before getting back to idle state.
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{happy_8py}{src/states/happy.\+py}}}}\+: final state in which Mi\+Ro signals the completion of his objective before shutting down.
