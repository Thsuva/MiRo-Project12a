## \file active.py 
##\brief The class Active handles the active state.
## @n ACTIVE has:
## @n - output (active_out): a list containing an action, a color and a target given by the parser and not empty. It's the output for the successful outcome.
## @n - outcome (successful): miro menaged to understand a command given by the user and get ready to execute it.
## @n - outcome (time_failure): miro didnt menaged to understand a command in the time window given, and moves to failure state.
