The functions inside \mbox{\hyperlink{parser_8py}{parser.\+py}} are usefull in order to extract information and keywords from the string published in the topic \textquotesingle{}/speech to text\textquotesingle{}. It\textquotesingle{}s return depends on various factor and can eather be a triple, a single word, or a None object. ~\newline
 The string gets changed in lower case than transformed in a list of single word. ~\newline
 If the calling state is A\+C\+T\+I\+VE each element of the firts list are compared with each element of standard allowed keyword for each of three category. If a keyword for each category is found in the list a triplet is made with the result and is returned. ~\newline
 If the calling state is I\+D\+LE the element in the list are compared to a \textquotesingle{}wakeup word\textquotesingle{} and if that is present its returned. ~\newline
 The standard return for this funcion is a None object that signifies that an error occurred and not enough information has been extracted from the speech to text string.

Simple function that check if one of the key\+\_\+word in list1 is present in list2 and returns it. 

Otherwise it retrurns an empty string \mbox{\Hypertarget{parser_8py_a0fd98339e2dfd44bf343d670e14eba31}\label{parser_8py_a0fd98339e2dfd44bf343d670e14eba31}}

The function deals with the set up for the searching of key\+\_\+word ~\newline
 ~\newline
 If the calling state is A\+C\+T\+I\+VE it repeat the search 3 times looking for keyword inside 3 list of different category returning a list with on item from each list if found or None otherwise. 

~\newline
 If the calling state is I\+D\+LE it looks for the wake\+\_\+up\+\_\+word inside the parsed string returning it if it is found or None otherwise.
